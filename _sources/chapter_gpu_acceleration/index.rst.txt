GPU and Hardware Acceleration
=============================

Install packages
----------------

For this course, we will use some ongoing development in TVM, which is
an open-source machine learning compilation framework. We provide the
following command to install a packaged version for MLC course. The
particular notebook of **part 1** depends on a CUDA 11 environment.

.. raw:: latex

   \diilbookstyleinputcell

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m pip install mlc-ai-nightly-cu110 -f https://mlc.ai/wheels

**NOTE: Our build system does not have GPU support yet, so part of codes
will not be evaluated.**
